'''We can see that on average, weekend tickets are more expensive than weekday tickets. However, based on this plot it seems like itâ€™s easier to get a good deal on a first-class ticket on a weekday than on a weekend: the price difference between first-class and coach level tickets is larger on the weekend than on a weekday.'''
